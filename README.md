# Relax bot 
This bot for searching keywords in new chat messages and
notify subscribed user about new messages with keywords

It could be handy if you don't like to read tons of messages,
but don't want to miss important event like when someone calls 
others to picnic or beach.

Thus, you can use this bot in various situations when you need to
read special message, but you can't read chat constantly

# How to use
1. tg_bot.py - bot for user interaction
2. tg_bot_searcher.py - bot for searching messages with keywords
3. both processes should be run in parallel

# TODOs for bot completion

19. BUG? - seems like bot only send one message per keyword even if there are few users looking for this key
24. Fix logging (make special bot command with password which send me debug.log)
29. Notification system? To push news and updates to users from admin directly (Or I can add all info into "about" section)
30. Feature: Add searching presets (most usable words for different activities: bar, beach, volley, English club)
